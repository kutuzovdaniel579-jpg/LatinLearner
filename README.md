VIÆ — OpenFluxLab
A modern multilingual vocabulary platform built on structure, clarity, and Latin roots.
VIÆ (pronounced VIAE, using the classical Æ ligature) is an open, modular learning platform focused primarily on Latin, with structured support for English, French, Dutch, and Russian.
The project is developed under FoL — OpenFluxLab, emphasizing clean data design, consistency, and developer‑friendly formats.

🌐 Overview
VIÆ provides a lightweight JSON‑based vocabulary engine designed for:

language learners

developers building language tools

educational platforms

automated quiz or lookup systems

Every vocabulary entry follows a strict, unified schema, making the dataset predictable, scalable, and easy to integrate into any environment.

📚 Supported Languages
Latin (primary)

English

French

Dutch

Russian

Additional languages can be added without breaking the existing structure.

🧩 Data Structure
All vocabulary entries follow the same JSON format:

json
{
  "word": {
    "NL": "Dutch meaning",
    "LA": "Latin form",
    "Gen": "Genitive / grammar info",
    "Tel": "Roman numeral (optional)"
  }
}
This structure is optimized for:

fast parsing

clean UI rendering

cross‑platform compatibility

automated processing
